# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

## 1️⃣ Employee Survey Data

### Transformations:

* Decoded Environment Satisfaction values into readable text categories
* Decoded Job Satisfaction values into readable text categories
* Decoded Work Life Balance values into readable text categories
* Replaced missing values using the median value (3)

### Why Median?

The median was used instead of the mean because it is less affected by outliers and better preserves the natural distribution of ordinal survey ratings.

---

## 2️⃣ General Data

### Transformations:

* Decoded Education values into readable categories
* Removed Employee Count column because it contained a constant value for all employees
* Replaced missing values in Number of Companies Worked using the median value (2)
* Replaced missing values in Total Working Years using the median value (10)
* Removed Over18 column because all employees had the same value
* Removed Standard Hours column because all employees had the same value (8)
* Added Age Group column
* Added Distance Group column
* Added Distance Sort column for proper visual sorting

---

## 3️⃣ In Time & Out Time Tables

### Transformations:

* Unpivoted both tables
* Converted dates from columns into rows
* Replaced null date values with:

```text
01-01-1900 12:00:00 AM
```

* Added a separate Date column

### Why Unpivoting?

Unpivoting transformed the data into a normalized structure suitable for:

* Time-series analysis
* Filtering
* Relationship modeling
* Attendance calculations

---

## 4️⃣ Manager Survey Data

### Transformations:

* Decoded Job Involvement values into readable text categories
* Decoded Performance Rating values into readable text categories

---

## 5️⃣ Attendance Table Creation

A new Attendance table was created by merging:

* In Time table
* Out Time table

### The table includes:

* Employee ID
* Date
* In Time
* Out Time
* Working Hours

### Additional Calculations:

* Working hours were calculated per employee per day.

---

# 🧠 Data Modeling

The project follows a **Star-Like Schema** design.

## Model Design:

* General Data acts as the central table
* Survey and attendance tables are connected using EmployeeID
* One-to-Many relationships were used for optimized filtering and aggregation
* A dedicated Measures Table was created to organize all DAX calculations

### Why Star Schema?

* Better Power BI performance
* Easier maintenance
* Simpler relationships
* More efficient DAX calculations
* Cleaner and scalable architecture

---
